**CSS3: Gradients**
CSS3 is going to introduce the
ability to specify a gradient for
the background of a box. The
gradient is created using the
background-image property
and, at the time of writing,
different browsers required a
different syntax.

**Contrast of background images**
- high contrast A high contrast background image makes the text difficult to read.
- low contrast a low constrast background image makes the text wasier to read 
- screen a screen added to a high contrast image makes the text easier to read

This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.
- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.
- You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.
- Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.
- You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.

load, you can create image sprites.
