In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems

Google became focused on building the perfect team 
- Google’s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together to which traits the best managers share
- The company’s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well
- study people’s habits and tendencies

**how teams worked**
- Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? 
- did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? 
- How often did teammates socialize outside the office?
- Did they have the same hobbies?
- Were their educational backgrounds similar? 
- Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy?

***‘We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘‘who’’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter.***
