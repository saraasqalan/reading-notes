**There is three type of list in HTML**
![type](https://www.litmus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-ultimate-guide-to-bulleted-lists-in-html-email.png)
1- orderd list
2- unorderered list
3- definition list

**order List**
![ol list](https://miro.medium.com/max/5120/1*GT0rMA_h7UIN44bfBunMFg.jpeg)
The ordered list is created with
the <ol> element.

**unorder List**
The ordered list is created with

**definition List**
The definition list is created with
the <dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
< dl >
   < dt >
      < dd >

***Most Important to Know***
- There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.

**HTML BOX Dimensions**
By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.
- Limiting Width (min-width, max-width)
- Limiting Height (min-height, max-height)
**Overflowing Content**
The overflow property tells the
browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger
than the box itself. It can have
one of two values:
- hidden
- scroll
**Border, Margin & Padding**
- Border
Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box
from anothe
- BORDER WIDTH (thin , medium ,thick)
- BORDER STYLE (solid ,dotted, dashed , double , groove , ridge , inset, outset ,hidden)
- BORDER COLOR (border-top-color,border-right-color ,border-bottom-color ,border-left-color)

- Margin
Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes
- Padding
Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

- SHORTHAND
The border property allows youto specify the width, style and color of a border in one property (and the values should be coded in that specific order).

- PADDING
The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border

- MARGIN
The margin property controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in pixels, although you may also use percentages or ems.

- Centering Content
If you want to center a box on the page (or center it inside the element that it sits in), you can set the left-margin and right-margin to auto.

**Change Inline/Block**
The display property allowsyou to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page
- inline
- block
- inline-block
- none

**Border Images**
The border-image property applies an image to the border of any box. It takes a background image and slices it into nine pieces.

**BOX SHADOWS**
The box-shadow property allows you to add a drop shadow around a box. It works just like the text-shadow property
- Horizontal offset
- Vertical offset
- Blur distance
- Spread of shadow

***Most important to know**
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
-  You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

# JAVASCRIPT ARRAYS
![array](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arrays-in-JavaScript.png)
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

**CREATING AN ARRAY**
- You create an array and give it
a name just like you would any
other variable (using the var
keyword followed by the name of
the array).  
- The values are assigned to the
array inside a pair of square
brackets, and each value is
separated by a comma. The
values in the array do not need
to be the same data type, so you
can store a string, a number and
a Boolean all in the same array

**VALUES IN ARRAYS**
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one)

**ACCESSING & CHANGING VALUES IN AN ARRAY**
The first lines of code on the leftcreate an array containing a list of three colors. (The values can be added on the same line or on separate lines as shown here.Having created the array, the third item on the list changed from 'custom' to 'beige'. 

**JS LOOPS**
![loops](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/07/JavaScript-Loops.jpg)
Loops check condition and if it true a code will run until it false we have more than one type of loop 
- for (for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array. )
- while
- do while (The key difference between a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1 e loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met. )

**most important to know**
- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
