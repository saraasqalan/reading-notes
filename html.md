 ## Important Thing About Design 
 - **Design** is about communication (Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.)
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style

the information

also The new **HTML5** elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure
and The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements)
 also the old vesion cant work with **HTML5** we should install other thing to make it work 

 ## Extra Markup in HTML5
Because there have beenseveral versions of **HTML**, each web page should begin with aDOCTYPE declaration to tell abrowser which version of **HTML**  There are some characters that are used in
and reserved by **HTML** code. (For example, the
left and right angled brackets.)

- You can add comments to your code between the<!-- and --> markers.
-  The id and class attributes allow you to identifyparticular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©
