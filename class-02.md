# html text 
**heading and paragraphs**
HTML has six "levels" of headings:
<h1> is used for main headings
<h2> is used for subheadings if there are further sections under the subheadings then the
<h3> element is used, and so on.
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening
  <p> tag and closing </p> tag.

**bold , italic**
- <b>
By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold. The <b> element also represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way (for example key words in a paragraph) although the use of the <b> element does not imply any additional meaning.

- <i>
By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic. The <i> element also represents a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content â€” such as technical terms, names of ships, foreign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually be italicized.

**structural and semantic mark up**
There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages
they are known as semantic markup
- <strong>
The use of the <strong>element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis. By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong> element in bold.
  
- <em>
The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. By default browsers will show the contents of an <em> element in italic.

# css
**what is css do**
- CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

**how css work**
ther is more than one type for css you can use it internal or external  also inline 

**must to know in css**
-  CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

-  Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

# java script
- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.

- You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code

- A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. 

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans. 

- An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

- An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 

- Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

**important to know**
- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. 

- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.

- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).

- Expressions evaluate into a single value.

- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 

# javascript Decisions 

there are often several places in a script where decisions are made that detrmine which lines of code should be run next 
we can use 
- ( < , > ,<=,>=)

- (== , != , === , !==)

- (&& , || ,!)

**SWITCH STATEMENTS**
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches 
that value.

**loobs**
loobs check condition if it returns true a code block will run then the condition will be checkes again and if it still returns true the code block will run agin 

- for

- while 

- do while
