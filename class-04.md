# HTML Link
**Writing Links**
Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

- When you are linking to other
pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the
domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a
relative URL.

**Relative URLs**
Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files
**there is a type for relative**
- Same folder
- Child folder
- Grandchild folder
- Parent folder
- Grandparent folder

**Email Links**

- mailto: chapter-04/email-links.html HTML
To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the <a>
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.
 - Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page (At the top of a long page
you might want to add a list
of contents that links to the
corresponding sections lower
down. Or you might want to add
a link from part way down the
page back to the top of it to save
users from having to scroll back
to the top.)
 ***Most important to know***
 - Links are created using the <a> element.
- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

# HTML Layout
![layout](https://www.101computing.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/HTML-Layout-2.png)
- Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
Building Blocks : CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
- Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.
- Controlling the Position of Elements
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
- Screen Sizes
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.
- Screen Resolution
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.
- Page Sizes
Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

- Fixed Width Layouts
Fixed width layout
designs do not
change size as the
user increases
or decreases
the size of their
browser window.
Measurements tend
to be given in pixels.

***most to know***
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

**WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
 **declaring a function**
 to create a function you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces 
and you can call it by function name and but () after name
