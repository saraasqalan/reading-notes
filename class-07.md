**What's a Table?**
A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.

**BASIC TABLE STRUCTURE**
- <table> 
The <table> element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.

- <tr>
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening <tr> tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
<td> elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing </tr> tag.

- <td>
Each cell of a table is
represented using a <td>
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a
closing </td> tag.

- <th>
The <th> element is used just
like the <td> element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row. (The th stands for table
heading.) 

- <thead>
The headings of the table should
sit inside the <thead> element

- <tbody>
The body should sit inside the
<tbody> element. 

- <tfoot>
The footer belongs inside the
<tfoot> element.

***MOST TO KNOW ABOUT TABLE***
- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web
page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the <tr> element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a
header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>,
<tbody>, and <tfoot>.

# JS Functions, Methods, and Objects
![function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ATL-WDI-Curriculum/js-objects-and-json/master/images/object-property-method.jpg)

**creating an object constructor notation**
the new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object you can then add properties and methods to the object

**updating an object**
to update the value of propeties ude dot nation or square brackets the work on object created using literal or constructor notation to delete a property use the delete keyword

**CREATING MANY OBJECTS: CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION**
Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things.
Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.
First, create the template with the object's properties and methods. 

**arrays are object**
arrays are actually a special type of object they hold a related set of key/value pairs but the key for each value is its index number

**arrays of objects & objects in array**
you can combine arrays and object to create complex data structures : array can store a series of objects

***MOST IMPORTANT TO KNOW***
- Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
