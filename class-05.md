# HTML IMAGE

**How to add images to pages**
A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one
 - If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.
- Adding Images
 - To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes
 -  SRC This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called image
 - alt This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
 - title You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.
